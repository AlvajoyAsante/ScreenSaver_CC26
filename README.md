> *This is my entry to the CEMETCH CC26 contest, held in November 2023*. This year's contest theme is "Screen Saver."
> Inspired by the desire to showcase the meaning of the community, I embarked on a journey to develop a collection of CE game screen savers.
> I managed to develop the program in 3 days, so the code isn't that optimized.

Scrolling TV's were the most fun to create overall and very simple to implement.
